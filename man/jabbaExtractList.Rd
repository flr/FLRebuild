\title{Extract Data from List of JABBA Fit Objects}
\usage{
jabbaExtractList(jabbaList)
}
\arguments{
\item{jabbaList}{List of JABBA fit objects. Can be named or unnamed.
If unnamed, identifiers are created as character sequence numbers.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{posteriors}: data.frame with posterior samples, including
      \code{.id} column for identification
    \item \code{trajectory}: data.frame with Kobe trajectory, including
      \code{.id} column
    \item \code{priors}: data.frame with prior parameters, including
      \code{.id} column
  }
  Components are NULL if no valid data is found.
}
\description{
Internal helper function to extract and combine data from a list of JABBA
fit objects. Each element in the list should be a single JABBA fit object
(or list with $fit element). Results are combined into data.frames with
an identifier column (.id).
}
\details{
This function processes multiple JABBA fits in a single list structure.
It uses \code{jabbaExtract()} for each element and combines results using
\code{rbindlist()} from the data.table package for efficiency.
