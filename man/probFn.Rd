\title{Calculate Kobe Quadrant Probabilities (Threshold Method)}
\usage{
probFn(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.frame with columns 'stock' and 'harvest' containing
relative values (e.g., B/BMSY, F/FMSY)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns:
  \item{red}{Probability of being in red quadrant (collapsed: B < 1 and F > 1)}
  \item{green}{Probability of being in green quadrant (sustainable: B >= 1 and F <= 1)}
  \item{yellow}{Probability of being in yellow quadrant (overfished only: B < 1 and F <= 1)}
  \item{orange}{Probability of being in orange quadrant (overfishing only: B >= 1 and F > 1)}
  \item{overFished}{Probability that stock is overfished (B < 1)}
  \item{overFishing}{Probability that overfishing is occurring (F > 1)}
}
\description{
Calculates probabilities for Kobe plot quadrants based on threshold values.
Determines whether stock and harvest are above/below reference points (1.0)
and calculates probabilities for red (collapsed), green (sustainable),
yellow (overfished only), and orange (overfishing only) quadrants.
}
\details{
The function converts stock and harvest values to binary indicators:
\itemize{
  \item b = 1 if stock >= 1 (not overfished), 0 otherwise
  \item f = 1 if harvest <= 1 (not overfishing), 0 otherwise
}

Then calculates:
\itemize{
  \item green = f * b (both sustainable)
  \item red = (1 - b) * (1 - f) (both unsustainable)
  \item yellow = 1 - green - red (other combinations)
}
}
