\title{Extract Production Function and Process Error from JABBA Fit}
\usage{
jabbaPE(fit, xMax = 1.5, nX = 200, use = c("median", "mean"), m.default = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A JABBA model fit object (typically from \code{jabba()} or
\code{fit_jabba()})}

\item{xMax}{Numeric. Maximum relative biomass (B/K) for production function
evaluation (default: 1.5). The production function is evaluated from
0.01 to \code{xMax}.}

\item{nX}{Numeric. Number of points at which to evaluate the production
function (default: 200). Higher values provide smoother curves but
increase computation time.}

\item{use}{Character. Which posterior statistic to use for parameters:
"median" (default) or "mean"}

\item{m.default}{Numeric. Default value for shape parameter m if not found
in posterior (default: 2, corresponding to Schaefer model)}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
  \item{pf}{A data.frame containing the theoretical production function
    with columns:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{bRel}: Relative biomass (B/K)
      \item \code{b}: Absolute biomass (B)
      \item \code{sp}: Surplus production (P)
    }}
  \item{traj}{A data.frame containing the realized production trajectory
    with columns:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{year}: Year (end of interval)
      \item \code{sp}: Realized surplus production
      \item \code{bRel}: Starting relative biomass (B/K)
      \item \code{b}: Starting absolute biomass
      \item \code{catch}: Observed catch
      \item \code{pe}: Process error (log residuals from state equation)
    }}

\description{
Extracts production function parameters and process error information from
a JABBA (Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment) model fit object.
This function calculates both the theoretical Pella-Tomlinson production
curve and the realized production trajectory from the fitted model.
}
\details{
This function performs two main calculations:

\strong{1. Production Function (Pella-Tomlinson):}
The theoretical production function is calculated as:
\deqn{P = r \times B \times (1 - (B/K)^m)}{P = r * B * (1 - (B/K)^m)}

where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{r} is the intrinsic growth rate from JABBA
  \item \eqn{B} is absolute biomass
  \item \eqn{K} is carrying capacity from JABBA
  \item \eqn{m} is the shape parameter (m=2 for Schaefer, m=1 for Fox)
  \item \eqn{x = B/K} (relative biomass)
}

\strong{2. Realized Production Trajectory:}
The realized production is calculated from the biomass dynamics:
\deqn{P_t = B_{t+1} - B_t + C_t}{P_t = B_{t+1} - B_t + C_t}

where \eqn{C_t} is catch. This represents the actual surplus production
observed in the data, which can be compared to the theoretical curve.

Process error is calculated as the log residual from the state equation:
\deqn{\epsilon_t = \log(B_{t+1} / \mu_t)}{eps_t = log(B_{t+1} / mu_t)}

where \eqn{\mu_t = B_t + P_t - C_t}{mu_t = B_t + P_t - C_t} is the expected
biomass at time t+1.

The function extracts:
\itemize{
  \item Model parameters (r, K, m) from JABBA posterior distributions
  \item Biomass estimates from timeseries
  \item Observed catches
  \item Process error residuals
}
}
\note{
This function requires a JABBA fit object with the standard structure:
\itemize{
  \item \code{fit$pars_posterior}: Matrix of posterior parameter samples
  \item \code{fit$timeseries}: Array with biomass timeseries
  \item \code{fit$est.catch}: Matrix with estimated catches
}
}
