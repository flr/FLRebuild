\title{Plot Summary for JABBA Fit Objects}
\usage{
jbplot(jb)
}
\arguments{
\item{jb}{List of JABBA objects. Each element should be a list with at
least two components, where the second component (\code{[[2]]}) is the
JABBA fit object. Typically created by \code{jabba()} which returns
\code{list(input = ..., fit = ...)}.}
}
\value{
The result of \code{jbplot_summary()} applied to the successfully
  extracted fit objects. Returns NULL if no valid fits are found.
}
\description{
Creates summary plots for a list of JABBA fit objects. This function
extracts the fit component from each JABBA object (which typically has
structure list(input, fit)) and generates diagnostic/summary plots.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
  \item Extracts the fit component (second element) from each JABBA object
  \item Uses \code{tryIt()} to safely handle extraction errors
  \item Filters out NULL results (failed extractions)
  \item Passes valid fits to \code{jbplot_summary()} for plotting
}

The function is designed to handle lists where some elements may be NULL
or have invalid structure, gracefully skipping them.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create list of JABBA fits
fits <- list(
  scenario1 = jabba(catch = catch1, pr = priors1),
  scenario2 = jabba(catch = catch2, pr = priors2)
)

# Generate summary plots
jbplot(fits)
}
