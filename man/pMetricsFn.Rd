\title{Performance metrics FLQuants for an operating model and reference BRP}
\usage{
pMetricsFn(om, eq, ...)

\S4method{pMetricsFn}{FLStock,FLBRP}(om, eq)
}
\arguments{
\item{om}{An \link[FLCore]{FLQuant} representing the operating model state
(typically stock numbers/biomass over time, possibly with iterations). [web:92]}

\item{eq}{An \link[FLBRP]{FLBRP} (or related reference object) providing
reference points via \code{refpts(eq)} such as MSY and virgin levels. [web:92]}
}
\value{
An \link[FLCore]{FLQuants} object with elements \code{SSB}, \code{Recruits},
\code{Yield}, \code{F}, \code{Forage}, \code{ABI}, and \code{Rebuild}. [web:92]
}
\description{
Constructs an \link[FLCore]{FLQuants} object of performance metrics from an
operating model and an equilibrium/reference object, including relative SSB,
recruitment, yield, fishing mortality, forage, ABI, and rebuild probability. [web:92]
}
\details{
The returned \link[FLCore]{FLQuants} contains:
\itemize{
  \item \code{SSB}: \code{ssb(x) / refpts(eq)["msy","ssb"]}.
  \item \code{Recruits}: first age (summed to age \code{"all"}) divided by
        \code{refpts(eq)["virgin","rec"]}.
  \item \code{Yield}: \code{catch(x) / refpts(eq)["msy","yield"]}.
  \item \code{F}: \code{fbar(x) / refpts(eq)["msy","harvest"]}.
  \item \code{Forage}: \code{forage(x)} relative to forage at
        \code{F = Fmsy} derived from \code{eq}.
  \item \code{ABI}: age-based indicator computed by \code{ABI(x, eq)}.
  \item \code{Rebuild}: rebuilding probability from \code{pBuild(ssb(x), eq,
        ftar = 0.5 * refpts(eq)["msy","harvest"])} with the first dimension
        renamed to \code{"age"}. [web:92]
}

Internally, each component is specified as an anonymous function of \code{x}
and evaluated within \code{FLQuants()}, so that the metrics can be computed
consistently across years and iterations of the operating model. [web:83]
