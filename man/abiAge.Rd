\title{Calculate the reference age for a FLBRP object}
\usage{
abiAge(object, ref = "msy", p = 0.9, ...)

\S4method{abiAge}{FLBRP}(object, ref = "msy", p = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An FLBRP object}

\item{ref}{Character string specifying the reference point (default = "msy")}

\item{p}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the cumulative proportion
threshold (default = 0.9)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
An FLQuant object containing reference ages.

An FLQuant object containing reference ages by year and iteration
}
\description{
This function calculates the reference age for a FLBRP object.

Calculates the reference age at which a specified proportion (p) of the
cumulative stock numbers is reached at a given reference point (e.g., MSY).
This age is used as a threshold for age-based indicator calculations.
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
  \item Sets fishing mortality to the specified reference point (e.g., FMSY)
  \item Calculates cumulative proportions of stock numbers by age
  \item Finds the minimum age at which cumulative proportion exceeds p
  \item Returns the reference age + 1 (or maximum age if threshold not reached)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(FLCore)
library(FLBRP)
data(ple4brp)

# Calculate reference age at FMSY with 90\% threshold
ref_age=abiAge(ple4brp, ref = "msy", p = 0.9)

# Calculate reference age at F0.1 with 95\% threshold
ref_age=abiAge(ple4brp, ref = "f0.1", p = 0.95)
}
