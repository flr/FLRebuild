\title{Extract Production Function and Process Error from SPiCT Fit}
\usage{
spictPE(fit, xMax = 1.3, nX = 200)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A SPiCT model fit object (typically from \code{fit.spict()})}

\item{xMax}{Numeric. Maximum relative biomass (B/K) for production function
evaluation (default: 1.3). The production function is evaluated from
0.01 to \code{xMax}.}

\item{nX}{Numeric. Number of points at which to evaluate the production
function (default: 200). Higher values provide smoother curves but
increase computation time.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
  \item{pf}{A data.frame containing the theoretical production function
    with columns:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{bRel}: Relative biomass (B/K)
      \item \code{b}: Absolute biomass (B)
      \item \code{sp}: Surplus production (P)
    }}
  \item{traj}{A data.frame containing the realized production trajectory
    with columns:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{year}: Year (end of interval)
      \item \code{sp}: Realized surplus production
      \item \code{spHat}: Predicted surplus production
      \item \code{bRel}: Starting relative biomass (B/K)
      \item \code{b}: Starting absolute biomass
      \item \code{catch}: Observed catch
      \item \code{cHat}: Predicted catch
      \item \code{bRsdl}: Biomass residuals (from fit$process.resid)
      \item \code{fRsdl}: Fishing mortality residuals (from fit$process.resid)
    }}

\description{
Extracts production function parameters and process error information from
a SPiCT (Stochastic Production model in Continuous Time) model fit object.
This function calculates both the theoretical Pella-Tomlinson production
curve and the realized production trajectory from the fitted model.
}
\details{
This function performs two main calculations:

\strong{1. Production Function (Pella-Tomlinson):}
The theoretical production function is calculated as:
\deqn{P = \gamma \times MSY \times (x - x^n)}{P = gamma * MSY * (x - x^n)}

where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{\gamma = \frac{1}{n-1} \times n^{n/(n-1)}}{gamma = (1/(n-1)) * n^(n/(n-1))}
  \item \eqn{x = B/K} (relative biomass)
  \item \eqn{n} is the shape parameter from SPiCT
  \item \eqn{MSY} is maximum sustainable yield
  \item \eqn{K} is carrying capacity
}

\strong{2. Realized Production Trajectory:}
The realized production is calculated from the biomass dynamics:
\deqn{P_t = B_{t+1} - B_t + C_t}{P_t = B_{t+1} - B_t + C_t}

where \eqn{C_t} is catch. This represents the actual surplus production
observed in the data, which can be compared to the theoretical curve.

The function extracts:
\itemize{
  \item Model parameters (n, MSY, K) from the SPiCT fit
  \item Biomass estimates at integer years
  \item Observed and predicted catches
  \item Process residuals (biomass and fishing mortality)
}
}
\note{
This function requires the \code{spict} package and expects a SPiCT fit
object with the standard structure. The function uses \code{get.par()} from
the spict package to extract parameters.
