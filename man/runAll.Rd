\title{Run Diagnostics for Multiple JABBA Fits}
\usage{
runAll(jb)
}
\arguments{
\item{jb}{Named list of JABBA fit objects. Each element should be a JABBA
fit object that can be processed by \code{runDiags()}. List names are
used as identifiers (typically stock IDs or scenario names).}
}
\value{
data.frame with diagnostic results for all fits, combined using
  \code{rbind()}. Contains all diagnostic columns (convergence, residuals,
  terminal parameters). Fits that return NULL are skipped. All data.frames
  are standardized to have the same columns before combining.
}
\description{
Runs diagnostics on a list of JABBA fit objects (e.g., multiple stocks
or scenarios). Processes each fit and combines results into a single
data.frame with standardized columns.
}
\details{
This function processes multiple JABBA fits in a single call:
\itemize{
  \item Loops through each element in the list
  \item Calls \code{runDiags()} for each fit
  \item Skips NULL results (failed diagnostics)
  \item Standardizes columns using \code{chkCols()} to ensure all
    data.frames can be combined
  \item Combines all results into a single data.frame
}

This is useful for batch processing diagnostics across multiple stocks
or scenarios.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run diagnostics for multiple stocks
jb_fits <- list(
  stock1 = jabba_fit1,
  stock2 = jabba_fit2,
  stock3 = jabba_fit3

all_diagnostics <- runAll(jb_fits)
