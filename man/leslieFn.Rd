\title{Calculate Leslie Matrix Demographic Properties}
\usage{
leslieFn(x, fbar = FLQuant(c(refpts(x)["msy", "harvest"])))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An FLBRP object containing life history information}

\item{fbar}{An FLQuant object specifying the fishing mortality rate. 
Default is MSY harvest rate from reference points.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing:
  \item{damp}{Damping ratio - the ratio of the first to second largest eigenvalue moduli.
    Indicates how quickly a population returns to stable age distribution after perturbation.}
  \item{r}{Intrinsic population growth rate (log of dominant eigenvalue)}
  \item{gt}{Generation time - mean age of reproduction weighted by survivorship and fecundity}
  \item{r0}{Net reproductive rate (R0) - expected lifetime reproductive output}
}
\description{
This function computes demographic parameters from a Leslie population matrix,
including damping ratio, intrinsic growth rate, generation time, and net reproductive rate.
}
\details{
The function constructs a Leslie matrix using FLife::leslie() and derives key demographic
parameters. The damping ratio measures resilience to age structure perturbations. Generation
time represents the average time between generations weighted by reproductive contributions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calculate demographic properties at MSY
demo_params <- leslieFn(brp_object)

# Calculate at a specific fishing mortality
demo_params <- leslieFn(brp_object, fbar = FLQuant(0.2))
}
