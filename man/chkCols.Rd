\title{Standardize Columns Across Diagnostic Data Frames}
\usage{
chkCols(diagsList)
}
\arguments{
\item{diagsList}{List of data.frames. Each element should be a diagnostic
result data.frame (typically from \code{runDiags()}).}
}
\value{
List of data.frames with identical column structure. All data.frames
  will have all columns that appear in any element, with missing columns
  filled with NA.
}
\description{
Helper function to ensure all diagnostic data.frames in a list have the
same columns. Missing columns are added and filled with NA values. This is
necessary when combining diagnostics from multiple fits that may have
different available diagnostics.
}
\details{
When combining diagnostics from multiple JABBA fits, some fits may have
missing components (e.g., no residuals, no convergence diagnostics).
This function ensures all data.frames can be safely combined using
\code{rbind()} by standardizing their column structure.
